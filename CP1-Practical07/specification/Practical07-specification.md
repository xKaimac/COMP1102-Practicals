##Arrays
###Aims and Objectives
This laboratory has been designed to help you
- allow you to exercise your array declaration, initialisation and manipulation skills,
- give you practice in defining classes which use an array as the basis for an implementation
   of a a sequential data structure, such as a list.

###Task 1
The **main** method in the class `ArrayTask` declares and initialises an array named `intList` (or
more precisely, the variable `intList` contains a reference to an array object) to contain the five
int values 5, 20, 32, 7 and 9.

```java
public class ArrayTask {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] intList = {5, 20, 32, 7, 9};
        for (int i = 0; i < intList.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("intList[" + i + "]: " + intList[i]);
        }
    }
}
```
The for loop prints out each element of the array, producing the following output:  <br><br>
**<tt>intList[0]: 5  
intList[1]: 20  
intList[2]: 32  
intList[3]: 7  
intList[4]: 9</tt>**

Modify the _for loop_ in the **main** method of `ArrayTask.java` so that the values in the array `intList` are printed
   out in reverse order.  
When run, the modified program should produce the following output:  <br><br>
   **<tt>intList[4]: 9  
   intList[3]: 7  
   intList[2]: 32  
   intList[1]: 20  
   intList[0]: 5</tt>**  
---   
###Checkpoint 32
   Have the program source code and output marked by a demonstrator

---
###Task 2
For this task you will add code to the program from Task 1 so that it also calculates and prints
the sum of all the elements in the array `intList`.
1. Add statements to the **main** method as described below.  
   1. Declare an `int` variable called `sum` and initialise it to 0.
   2. Include an additional statement in the _for loop_ which adds the *ith* element of the
      array to the variable `sum`.
   3. Include a statement to print the value of sum (see example below).
2. Run the program. The following output should be produced:  <br><br>
   **<tt>intList[4]: 9  
   intList[3]: 7  
   intList[2]: 32  
   intList[1]: 20  
   intList[0]: 5  
   Sum = 73</tt>**  
---
###Checkpoint 33
Have the program source code and output marked by a demonstrator

---

###Task 3
For this task you will add code to the program from Task 2 so that it makes a copy of the array
and increases each element by 1.
1. Add statements to the **main** method as described below.
   1. Each value in `intList` should be increased by 1 (this must be done by changing
   the values in the array and not by adding 1 when the value is printed). The
   resulting output should now be:  <br><br>
   **<tt>intList[4]: 10  
   intList[3]: 8  
   intList[2]: 33  
   intList[1]: 21  
   intList[0]: 6  
   Sum = 78</tt>**  
   2. Declare another array called `copy` with the same type as `intList`. That is, it is also
   an array of 5 ints.
   3. Immediately after the declaration of copy, include another _for loop_ which assigns to
   each element of `copy` the respective element of `intList`. After doing this both arrays
   should contain the same values. Include statements to calculate and then print the
   sum of the elements of `copy`.
2. Run the program. The output should be the following:  <br><br>
   **<tt>intList[4]: 10  
   intList[3]: 8  
   intList[2]: 33  
   intList[1]: 21  
   intList[0]: 6  
   Sum of intList = 78  
   Sum of copy = 73</tt>**

###Task 4
For this task you will define and add another class
1. Change the **main** method to contain the following code:
    ```java
       public class ArrayTask {
           public static void main (String[] args) {
               IntList list1 = new IntList();
               list1.printList();
               list1.insertatEndofList(42);
               list1.printList();
               list1.insertAtEndofList(2);
               list1.printList();
               System.out.println(list1.getElementAt(3));
               System.out.println(list1.getElementAt(-1));
               System.out.println(list1.getElementAt(1));
               list1.insertAtEndofList(7);
               list1.insertAtEndofList(9);
               list1.printList();
               list1.insertAtEndofList(100);
           }
       }
    ```
2. Create a new class called `IntList`.   
   The aim of the class is to represent a list. It is
   initially empty but can have elements inserted at the end of it. Since arrays are not
   extensible, one way to represent the list is to create an array which is long enough for all
   foreseeable circumstances and to keep track of how much of the array is being used with
   another variable. Initially this variable will be zero and each time a value is inserted it
   will become one larger. The class should include the following:
   1. An instance variable which refers to an array containing 4 _ints_.
   2. An instance variable called `listLength` to keep track of how many elements of the
   array are being used. It should be initialised to 0.
   3. A method called `printList` which prints out all the elements in the list. If the list
   does not contain any elements then **"List is empty"** should be printed (see example
   output below).
   4. A method called `insertAtEndofList` which inserts a value (provided as a formal
   parameter) at the end of the list. To do this it should use `listLength` to index the
   array and assign the value to that element of the array. `listLength` should then be
   increased by 1 and a message produced (see example below).  <br><br>
   Prior to performing the insertion the method should check that there are unused
   elements in the array (make use of the `length` attribute of the array and `listLength`).
   If there are not, the insertion should not be performed and an appropriate message
   should be output (see example below).
   5. A method called `getElementAt` which returns the value at a given index (similar to
   array indexing). It should check that the index passed as a parameter is that of an
   element which is being used. For example, after adding two elements to a list (calling
   `insertAtEndofList` twice), the only valid indexes will be 0 and 1. If the index is not
   valid, a message should be printed and 0 returned (see example below).
   
   A good strategy to adopt in developing this class is to write and test each method one at
   a time. To do this you will need to comment out those lines in the **main** method which
   call methods which have not been written yet. You may also want to set up the contents
   of the list manually so, for example, you could write and test `printList`. e.g.
   ```java
   private int[] theList = {42,2,0,0};
   private int listLength = 2;
   ```
   Once you are convinced `printList` is performing correctly you will need to change the
   above declarations to represent an empty list with a maximum length 4 (instead of
   explicitly initialising the array).
   **Note**: The **main** method should not be changed from that given above.
   The final output of your program should be:  <br><br>
   **<tt>List is empty  
   42 inserted  
   Printing list...  
   Element 0 = 42  
   2 inserted  
   Printing list...  
   Element 0 = 42  
   Element 1 = 2  
   Invalid index: 3  
   0  
   Invalid index: -1  
   0  
   2  
   7 inserted  
   9 inserted  
   Printing list...  
   Element 0 = 42  
   Element 1 = 2  
   Element 2 = 7  
   Element 3 = 9  
   Insertion of 100 failed</tt>**

###Task 5 (Extension Practice)
1. Change the **main** method to contain the following code:
```java

public class ArrayTask {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        IntList list1 = new IntList();
        list1.insertatEndofList(42);
        list1.insertAtEndofList(2);
        list1.insertAtEndofList(7);
        list1.printList();
        if(list1.contains(2)) {
            System.out.println("Contains 2");
        }
        if(list1.contains(54)) {
            System.out.println("Contains 54");
        }
        list1.delete(99);
        list1.delete(2);
        list1.printList();
        list1.insertAtEndofList(2);
        list1.printList();
    }
}
```
2. Extend the class `IntList` to include the following methods:
   1. A method called `contains` which returns **true** if the value, passed as a parameter, is
   contained in the list. Otherwise, **false** is returned (see example below).
   2. A method called `delete` which deletes the first occurrence of the value, passed as a
   parameter, from the list. As a result the list will become shorter by one and all the
   elements after the deleted value will be shifted to the left by one position to remove
   the _“hole”_ (see example below)
   
   The final output of your program should be:  <br><br>
   **<tt>42 inserted  
   2 inserted  
   7 inserted  
   Printing list...  
   Element 0 = 42  
   Element 1 = 2  
   Element 2 = 7  
   Contains 2  
   Deletion of 99 failed  
   2 deleted  
   Printing list...  
   Element 0 = 42  
   Element 1 = 7  
   2 inserted  
   Printing list...  
   Element 0 = 42  
   Element 1 = 7  
   Element 2 = 2</tt>**
