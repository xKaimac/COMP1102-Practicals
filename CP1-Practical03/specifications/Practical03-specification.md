## Decisions

For this lab exercise we will begin to look at making decisions within our code. Selection or decisions are a key
component of any program that you write. By allowing the program to make decisions based on values provided not only
allows for interactivity but also enables a generalised set of instructions that could be applied to many variations of
execution.

### Simple Flow of Control

_**if**_ Statement, _**if . . . else**_ Statement

In the programs you have seen so far, we have had a list of statements, which were executed in the order that they were
written in your program (the `.java` file). In more complicated programs, you may need to change the order in which
statements are executed. The order of execution for statements in your program is referred to as **flow of control**.

Let’s look at one example. Suppose you are organising an event that costs $12 for everyone older than 8 and $6 for
anyone 8 years or younger. One way to do this is to say the ticket is $12, unless you are 8 or younger, then it is $6.
In this case, you can write:

| pseudo code                                                                    |     | java equivalent                                                          |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| if age is less than or equal to 8 then<br/>ticket = 6<br/>else<br/>ticket = 12 |     | <pre>if(age <= 8)<br>   ticket = 6; <br/>else <br/>   ticket = 12;</pre> |

There is another way to do this.

| pseudo code                                                                     |     | java equivalent                                                                            |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ticket = 12<br/> age <br/>if age is less than or equal to 8 then<br/>ticket = 6 |     | <pre>double ticket = 12.0; <br/>double age;<br/>if(age <= 8)<br>   ticket = 6; <br/></pre> |

Both of these do the same thing. In both cases, you will change the flow of execution when you reach the statement; “**
age is 8 or younger**”. If that statement happens to be true, i.e., age is 8 or younger, then the value of ticket will
change to $6, otherwise, you will go with its initialised value of $12.

In general, the statement in the parentheses is either **TRUE** or **FALSE**. Depending on that statement being true or
false, you will change the flow of execution of the statements in the program.   
In order for your program to decide about the flow of the execution, it uses a comparison operator.

Examples of comparison operators are:

1) _equal to_ , = , which will be written as == (2 =’s) in java, with a general form of:  
   _statement1 == statement2_.  
   Example: `y == x + 1`
2) _not equal to_ ,&ne;, which will be written as _!=_ in java, with a general form of:  
   _statement1 != statement2_.  
   Example: `y != x + 1`
3) less than , _<_, which will be written as _<_ in java, with a general form of:  
   _statement1 < statement2_.  
   Example: `y < x + 1`
4) less than or equal to ,&le;, which will be written as _<=_ in java, with a general form of:  
   _statement1 <= statement2_.  
   Example: `y <= x + 1`
5) greater than , >, which will be written as _>_ in java, with a general form of:  
   _statement1 > statement2_.  
   Example: `y > x + 1`
6) greater than or equal to ,&ge;, which will be written as _>=_ in java, with a general form of:  
   _statement1 >= statement2_.  
   Example: `y >= x + 1`
7) _**OR**_, which will be written as || (2 of the |’s) in java, with a general form of:  
   _statement1 || statement2_.  
   Which is _True_ when **EITHER** one of the two statements are **TRUE**.
8) **AND**, which will be written as && (2 of the &’s) in java, with a general form of:  
   _statement1 && statement2_.  
   Which is _True_ **ONLY** when **BOTH** statements are **TRUE**.

### Task 1: Ticket Code & Nested IF ... ELSE

Open the file `Ticket.java`.   
Now that you have learned about changing the flow of control, let’s write program code that asks users to enter an age
and displays the cost of the ticket based on the criteria that was given above. Use both methods to make sure.

Once you are confident that the code works as expected change it so that it displays $6 for people who are 8 years old
or younger _OR_ 65 years or older.

Open the file `NumberEvaluation.java`:  
Write a program that prompts the user to input a number. The program should then output the number and message saying
whether the number is “Positive, “Negative”, or “Zero”.

It should further output whether the number is odd or even (zero is counted as even)

### Checkpoint 12

Have the program source code and output marked by a demonstrator

### Task 2: More IF...ELSE statements

Open the file `CalculateBMI.java`. You need to write a program that accepts user input and then uses these values to
calculate the BMI category for that person. BMI is the body mass index of a person and is calculated by taking the
weight (in kilograms and dividing it by the square of your height in metres). The following table provides an
interpretation of the BMI based on calculated values:

| BMI         | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Below 18.5  | Underweight    |
| 18.5 - 24.9 | Normal         |
| 25.0 - 29.9 | Overweight     |
| Above 30.0  | Obese          |

Complete the code to output the correct interpretation (must be to one decimal place), i.e. output:  
**Your BMI is 22.4, which means you are in the Normal range.**

### Task 3: Ranges. . .

A packet of biscuits can hold 12 biscuits, and a box can hold 30 packets of biscuits.

Open the file `Biscuits.java` and write code that prompts the user to enter the total number of biscuits. The program
then outputs the number of packets and the number of boxes to ship the biscuits.

**Note**: Each packet must contain the specified number of biscuits, and each box must contain the specified number of
packets. If the last packet of biscuits contains less than the specified number of biscuits, you can discard it and
output the number of leftover biscuits. Similarly, if the last box contains less than the specified number of packets,
you can discard it and output the number of leftover packets.

_For example_ (user input in **bold**):  
Enter the number of biscuits: **360**

<tt>There are 30 packets of biscuits: 1 box with no leftover packets and no leftover biscuits</tt>

Enter the number of biscuits: **458**

<tt>There are 38 packets of biscuits: 1 box with 8 leftover packets and 2 leftover biscuits</tt>

Enter the number of biscuits: **1453**

<tt>There are 121 packets of biscuits: 4 boxes with 1 leftover packet and 1 leftover biscuit</tt>

**Note**: You may need to use the <tt>**conditional operator**</tt> to correctly format the output for singular and
plural. e.g.   
loBiscuits == 1 ? " leftover biscuit" : " leftover biscuits"

Have the program source code and output marked by a demonstrator

### Task 4: Reading, Storing and Outputting

1. You are to create a program that asks the user to supply one integer (in the range of 0-10 inclusive).
2. The program should generate a random number within the same range.
3. It should then present a menu to the user and query whether they would like to add, subtract, or multiply the two
   numbers.
4. Subtraction should subtract the second integer (random generated one) from the first (user supplied).
5. Display an error message if the user supplies an invalid response to the menu prompt.
6. Otherwise, display the results of the arithmetic operation.

Using the `SimpleCalculator.java` file as a starting point, create a program for the above specification (you should
consider using the **switch statement** or a series of **nested If/Else** statements).
